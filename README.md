Source code for Sections 2-6 of the [Ionic Angular Course](https://github.com/didaktio/Ionic-Angular-Course).

# DEMO
[https://s23456-13f0c.firebaseapp.com]

## Getting Started
1) Clone or download the repo.
2) Open a terminal at the root (or run `cd reminder-app`).
3) Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4) Rename `environments[EDIT AND RENAME]` to `environments`, and add your Firebase keys (as per the tutorial(s)).
5) Run `ionic s`.

## Hints
* Run a search of the src and functions/src directories for the string `[TODO]`, which may return minor changes you need to make to get things working properly.

## Possible Next Steps
* Implement [Push Notifications](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging).
* Add more user roles (e.g., admin, editor, owner...).
* Find ways to speed up user registration (such as by completing the task under the hood, and only bringing the user back if an error is thrown).
* Build the Liked Companies feature: create a database of companies, a search function, and a way to like/unlike.
* Make the Enterprise account actually worth paying for!
* Go crazy.
